# My Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website.

This site is an example of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is hosted directly from this repository.

Its blog aware content management is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) which is pre-installed in on github pages.

It uses jekyll with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
