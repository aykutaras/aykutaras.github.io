This is my personal development blog which I will hopefully try to update weekly.

This site is an example of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is hosted directly from this repository.

Its blog aware content management is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) which is pre-installed in on github pages.

Its theme is [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) which is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)
