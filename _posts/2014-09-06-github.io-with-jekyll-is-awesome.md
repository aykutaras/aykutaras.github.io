Hello everyone,

GitHub has a nice feature called [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) which allows you to create static-content websites hosted directly from your own GitHub repositories. You can create personal blogs, website for your organizations or your project pages. If you are already using GitHub, you are ready to go.

GitHub Pages allows you to create static-content pages but this doesn't stop us to create a blog using it. If you create your GitHub pages repository correctly, you can start blogging without thinking anything like hosting, creating db, etc.

Let me introduce you with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). Jekyll is an easier way to create blog aware sites. It does not have any DBMS, instead it uses static markdown or textile files to create blog posts and pages. Creating posts became really easy when you use markdown templating system. And guess what? Jekyll comes with GitHub pages. You don't need to think about installing or configuring. Just use the correct folder and file format that's all. For more information [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)

Unlike tumblr or wordpress, jekyll has few themes or templates for use. Even though you can create your own blogging site from scratch for a starter here is a great theme named [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). It has most of the features you will need and easy to configure (just copy paste though).

Using git as a SCM for blogging is a great idea and have many examples around writers. Also using GitHub more efficiently might be a good start to join GitHub community.

Preparing GitHub pages and jekyll system might not be the easiest solution for blogging when there are prepared solutions like Wordpress, Blogspot and Tumblr but as a developer I found that way more fun and entertaining.

That is it for now with my first blogging adventure with these tools.

Have fun...
